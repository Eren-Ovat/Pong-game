This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong. The game is played between two players: the user and an AI opponent. The objective is to bounce the ball back and forth, preventing it from passing through the player's goal, while trying to score points by making the ball pass through the opponent's goal.

## How to Play
- Use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to control the player paddle. The UP arrow key moves the paddle up, while the DOWN arrow key moves it down.
- The opponent AI will automatically move its paddle based on the ball's movement.
- The game starts with a countdown of 3 seconds after each score. The ball is then launched from the center of the playfield.
- Each time the ball passes through the opponent's goal, the player scores a point.
- The game continues until one of the players reaches the score limit or until the game is exited.

## Game Features
- Score Counter: The game keeps track of the players' scores, displaying them on the screen.
- Countdown: After each score, a 3-second countdown is displayed before the ball is launched again.
- Sound Effects: Sound effects are included to enhance the gaming experience.
